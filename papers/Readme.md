## Presentations and Links

CryptOpt has appeared in the press several times. This is an overview in the order of relevance:

- The main paper ([PLDI paper](./KuepperEWGCSTCCGWY23-PLDI23.pdf), [full version](./KuepperEWGCSTCCGWY23-PLDI23-full.pdf)) in the research-paper track of the _44th ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation (PLDI 2023)_ as part of _FCRC’23_ in Orlando.
  The paper received the _Distinguished Paper_ award.
  The full link to the entry is: [on the Sigplan Website](https://pldi23.sigplan.org/details/pldi-2023-pldi/53/CryptOpt-Verified-Compilation-with-Randomized-Program-Search-for-Cryptographic-Primi).
  The talk is recorded and available [here on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/live/1L1eKWwa6fE?si=AMxFIYHohAEEbQph), [slides here](./presentations/pldi23/presentation.pdf).
  The submission contains an artifact that bears the DOI: `10.5281/zenodo.7710435`.

- Most recently, the work received the _Human-Competitive (HUMIES) GOLD Award_.
  The competition is held as part of _The Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO)_.
  All the winners of _GECCO 2023_ in Lisbon, are shown on the [SIGEVO website](https://gecco-2023.sigevo.org/Humies-Awards), [slides here](./presentations/gecco2023/Gecco Humies.pptx).

- The _Real World Crypto Symposium (RWC) 2023_ was held in Tokyo.
  CryptOpt’s first public appearance was at _RWC’23_ – the entry can be found [here](https://rwc.iacr.org/2023/program.php), and the talk is [here](https://youtu.be/lahO3de3k_0?t=2790), [slides here](./presentations/rwc23/presentation.pdf).

- The CryptOpt project made it into the bibliography of genetic programming, maintained by W. Langdon [here](http://gpbib.cs.ucl.ac.uk/gp-bibliography.bib).
  This is significant because it could be seen as a one-stop shop for the area of genetic programming or evolutionary computation in general.

- The engineering of the optimiser is described in a [paper](./KuepperEWGCSTCCGWY23-ICSE23-demo.pdf), published in the DEMO track of the _45th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE) 2023_ in Melbourne.
  The full link to the entry is [here](https://conf.researchr.org/details/icse-2023/icse-2023-demonstrations/3/CryptOpt-Automatic-Optimization-of-Straightline-Code), [slides here](./presentations/icse23/presentation.pdf).

- Monash University regularly holds _Software Systems and Cybersecurity (SSC)_ seminars.
  CryptOpt was the topic of the SSC seminar held on the 31st of January 2023.
  The entry is [here](https://www.monash.edu/it/ssc/seminars/2023/cryptopt-verified-compilation-with-random-program-search-for-cryptographic-primitives), and the recording is available [here](https://youtu.be/DZ0kaXNMtoA).
